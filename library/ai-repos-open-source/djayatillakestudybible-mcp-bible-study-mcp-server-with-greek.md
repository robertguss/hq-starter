```

When you ask Claude a Bible question:
1. Claude analyses your question and decides which tools to use
2. Claude calls the appropriate MCP tools (e.g., `lookup_verse`, `word_study`, `get_study_notes`)
3. The server queries the pre-built SQLite database
4. Results are returned to Claude
5. Claude synthesises the data into a helpful response

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for a full Mermaid flowchart of all 18 tools and how the agent chains them together.

### Example Conversation

**User**: "I'm studying Romans 5:8. What does Paul mean when he says God 'demonstrates' his love?"

**Claude's internal process**:
1. Look up the verse: `lookup_verse(reference="Romans 5:8")`
2. Study the key word: `word_study(word="demonstrates")` → finds G4921 συνίστημι
3. Get study notes: `get_study_notes(reference="Romans 5:8")`
4. Check cross-references for context
5. Apply genre guidance (Epistles)

**Claude's response**:
> In Romans 5:8, Paul uses the Greek word **συνίστημι** (synistēmi, G4921), which means "to stand together, to commend, to demonstrate." This is a present tense verb, indicating ongoing action.
>
> The genre context is important here: Romans is an epistle, and Paul is building an argument. In the immediate context (Romans 5:1-11), he's explaining how we have peace with God through justification by faith. Verse 8 is his proof: God didn't wait for us to become worthy, but demonstrated his love "while we were still sinners."
>
> The word "demonstrates" carries the sense of proving beyond doubt - not just telling us about his love, but showing it through action (Christ's death).
>
> Related passages on God's love demonstrated through Christ: John 3:16, 1 John 4:9-10.

## Hermeneutical Framework

This isn't just a reference tool. It's designed to guide users toward sound biblical interpretation.

### The Problem It Solves

Common interpretation errors include:
- **Proof-texting**: Using isolated verses to support predetermined conclusions
- **Allegorizing**: Finding hidden meanings not intended by the author
- **Ignoring genre**: Reading poetry as prose or prophecy as history
- **Ignoring context**: Ripping verses from their historical and literary setting
- **Moralizing**: Reducing narratives to "be good like David"

### The Fee & Stuart Method

The interpretive framework is based on **"How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth"** by Gordon Fee and Douglas Stuart - the standard textbook for biblical hermeneutics used in seminaries worldwide.

**About the authors:**
- **Gordon Fee** (1934-2022): New Testament scholar, professor at Regent College, author of major commentaries on 1 Corinthians, Philippians, and Pauline theology. One of the translators of the NIV and TNIV.
- **Douglas Stuart**: Old Testament scholar, professor at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, author of commentaries on Hosea-Jonah, Exodus, and Old Testament hermeneutics.

Their book (first published 1981, now in its 4th edition) has sold over a million copies and is used as the introductory hermeneutics text at most evangelical seminaries. It teaches readers to interpret Scripture according to its literary genre, historical context, and authorial intent - avoiding both wooden literalism and uncontrolled allegorizing.

The server embeds genre-specific interpretation principles from this methodology:

#### Core Principles

1. **Exegesis Before Application**
   - First discover what the text meant to its original audience
   - Then determine what it means for us today
   - Never jump directly to application

2. **Context is King**
   - Historical context: time, culture, author, audience, occasion
   - Literary context: genre, surrounding passages, book structure
   - A text without context is a pretext for a proof text

3. **Genre Determines Method**
   Different biblical literature requires different approaches

### Genre-Specific Guidelines

#### Epistles (Letters)
**Key principle**: Think contextually - what problem was being addressed?

- Read the entire letter to understand the argument flow
- Ask: What problem prompted this letter?
- Pay attention to logical connectors (therefore, because, so that)
- Distinguish between central argument and supporting points
- Not every statement is universally prescriptive

**Common errors**:
- Taking verses out of their argumentative context
- Ignoring the specific historical situation being addressed
- Treating every instruction as a timeless command

#### Old Testament Narratives
**Key principle**: Three levels (meta, national, individual); descriptive not prescriptive

- Narratives describe what happened, not necessarily what should happen
- Three levels: God's universal plan, Israel's story, individual accounts
- Characters are not always examples to follow - observe their flaws
- The narrator rarely makes direct theological statements
- God is the ultimate hero of every narrative

**Common errors**:
- Treating every character's action as a model to follow
- Allegorizing details that are simply historical facts
- Moralizing: "Be brave like David" without seeing God's work

#### Gospels
**Key principle**: Two-level documents (Jesus' original context + evangelist's purpose)

- Consider both Jesus' original meaning and the Gospel writer's purpose
- Each Gospel has a specific audience and theological emphasis
- Account for the already/not-yet tension of the Kingdom
- Compare parallel accounts to see each writer's emphasis

**Common errors**:
- Harmonizing too quickly without hearing each Gospel's voice
- Ignoring Jesus' audience (Pharisees, disciples, crowds)
- Applying teachings directly without considering the cross

#### Parables
**Key principle**: Find the main point; don't allegorize every detail

- Identify the one or two main points - parables are not allegories
- Consider the audience: Who is Jesus speaking to and why?
- Look for cultural background that illuminates meaning
- The unexpected twist often carries the main message

**Common errors**:
- Allegorizing every detail (the donkey represents X...)
- Missing the shock value for the original audience
- Creating theological systems from parabolic details

#### Prophets
**Key principle**: Covenant enforcement; check if "future" is now past

- Prophets were covenant enforcement officers - calling Israel back
- Most "predictions" were about events now in our past
- The prophetic lawsuit pattern: accusation, judgment, hope
- Distinguish near fulfillment from ultimate/eschatological fulfillment
- Poetry and metaphor are the normal mode of prophetic speech

**Common errors**:
- Reading all prophecy as about the end times
- Literalizing poetic and metaphorical language
- Creating detailed end-times timelines from prophetic poetry

#### Psalms
**Key principle**: Poetry/prayer; understand the types (lament, thanksgiving, praise)

- Psalms are inspired responses to God - poetry, not doctrine
- Identify the type: Lament, Thanksgiving, Praise, Royal, Wisdom
- Poetry uses metaphor, hyperbole, and parallelism
- The emotions are real and God-given - even the difficult ones
- Many psalms find their ultimate fulfillment in Christ

**Common errors**:
- Treating poetic expressions as doctrinal statements
- Ignoring the emotional dimension
- Literalizing metaphorical language

#### Wisdom Literature
**Key principle**: General truths, not guarantees; compare with full canon

- Proverbs are general truths, not unconditional promises
- Wisdom literature wrestles with life's complexity
- Job and Ecclesiastes challenge simplistic interpretations
- The fear of the Lord is the foundation of all wisdom
- Compare individual proverbs with the full biblical witness

**Common errors**:
- Treating Proverbs as unconditional promises
- Ignoring the dialogue format in Job (not all speeches are true)
- Missing the "under the sun" perspective in Ecclesiastes

#### Apocalyptic (Revelation)
**Key principle**: Apocalyptic imagery; already/not yet eschatology

- Apocalyptic is a literary genre with its own conventions
- Symbols are stock imagery (beasts, numbers) with recognized meanings
- The primary message is: God wins, evil is judged, Christ reigns
- Read in light of OT prophets and the already/not yet tension
- Multiple valid interpretive approaches exist

**Common errors**:
- Literalizing symbolic imagery (666 as a barcode)
- Creating detailed chronological timelines
- Missing the pastoral purpose: encouragement for suffering believers

### The Reasoning Pattern

The server's hermeneutics module guides Claude through this sequence:

1. **IDENTIFY**: What biblical text(s) are relevant?
2. **GENRE**: What type of literature is this?
3. **CONTEXT**: Historical, literary, canonical
4. **CONTENT**: What does the text say? (Greek/Hebrew when helpful)
5. **CROSS-REFERENCES**: Scripture interprets Scripture
6. **APPLICATION**: Timeless principle behind temporal commands
7. **HUMILITY**: Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists
