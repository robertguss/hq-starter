Blitz is a native macOS app for submitting iOS apps to **App Store Connect** using AI agents. It gives Claude Code (or any MCP client) full control over the iOS development lifecycle: running simulators, configuring in-app purchases, uploading screenshots, and triggering App Store review submissions, all from a single native macOS GUI.

If you are fighting App Store Connect to get your app submitted, Blitz automates the painful parts.

<p>―</p>

AIエージェントを活用してiOSアプリをApp Store Connectに提出するmacOSネイティブアプリ、Blitz。

このアプリを使えば、Claude Code（または任意のMCPクライアント）から、iOS開発ライフサイクル全体を完全に制御できます。シミュレータの実行、アプリ内課金の設定、スクリーンショットのアップロード、App Storeへの審査提出まで、すべて単一のmacOSネイティブGUIから実行できます。

App Store Connectでのアプリ提出に苦労しているなら、Blitzがその面倒な作業を自動化します。

## Download

[Download from blitz.dev](https://blitz.dev)

## Build from source

**Requirements:** macOS 14+ · Xcode 16+ · Node.js 18+ · Go 1.26+

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/blitzdotdev/blitz-mac.git
cd blitz-mac

# Fetch the pinned App Store Connect helper fork
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Debug build
swift build

# Release build
swift build -c release

# Bundle as .app (ad-hoc signed)
bash scripts/bundle.sh release

# The app is at .build/Blitz.app
open .build/Blitz.app
```

For signed builds, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Apple Developer credentials, then run:

```bash
bash scripts/bundle.sh release
```

The ASC helper binary bundled into the app is built from the pinned submodule at `deps/App-Store-Connect-CLI-helper`. If you need to override that source during development or CI, set `BLITZ_ASCD_SOURCE_DIR` or point `BLITZ_ASCD_PATH` at a prebuilt compatible helper binary.

## Verify a release binary

Every GitHub release includes `SHA256SUMS.txt` with checksums of the CI-built binary. To verify:

**Option 1: Check a downloaded binary against release checksums**
```bash
# Download both Blitz.app.zip and SHA256SUMS.txt from the GitHub release
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

**Option 2: Build from source and compare**
```bash
bash scripts/verify-build.sh v1.0.20
```

This builds the app locally and compares the main executable checksum against the release. CI builds use ad-hoc signing, so checksums match when you build with the same toolchain.

**Option 3: Inspect the CI build yourself**

All release binaries are built by the public [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml). The workflow is transparent — you can audit every step and verify that the published artifact matches what the workflow produced.

## Security and privacy

- **Minimal telemetry in official releases only.** GitHub release builds may embed a build-time analytics endpoint and token and send anonymous product telemetry. Source builds, forks, and debug builds stay off by default unless you explicitly embed analytics config while bundling.
- **What official telemetry records.** App launches, Blitz project type inventory/create/import events, and MCP/App Store Connect tool usage events. Each event includes an anonymous device ID stored at `~/.blitz/analytics/device-id`, app version, OS version, event name, timestamp, and when applicable `source` (`blitz_managed` or `agent_direct`), normalized command type, success, and duration.
- **What official telemetry never records.** No project names, paths, bundle IDs, CLI args, App Store Connect form values, file names, prompts, terminal contents, or user content.
- **App Wall sync is opt-in.** If you enable App Wall sync, Blitz sends the selected apps' public store listing metadata and submission history to the App Wall backend. Reviewer feedback is only sent when `Share reviewer feedback` is enabled.
- **Network requests depend on the features you use.** Beyond the optional anonymous telemetry above, Blitz may talk to a build-time-configured analytics ingest endpoint in official release builds, Apple's App Store Connect API, GitHub's releases API for update checks, the npm registry during install/update to refresh `@blitzdev/iphone-mcp`, and the App Wall backend when App Wall sync is enabled.
- **MCP server is localhost-only.** The built-in MCP server binds to `127.0.0.1` and is never exposed to the network.
- **No access to sensitive data.** The app does not access your contacts, photos, location, or any personal data. Screen capture is limited to the iOS Simulator window.

## Architecture

Single-target SwiftUI app built with Swift Package Manager. All source lives in `src/`. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Contributor TODO

- Improve auto-update performance and UX. The current `.app.zip` update path runs embedded `preinstall`/`postinstall` scripts during in-app updates, which can re-run heavyweight setup like Python, `idb`, and simulator checks. The preferred fix is a fast app-replacement path for normal updates, with toolchain repair/checks moved to first launch or background maintenance, plus real progress reporting during download/install.

## FAQ

### How long does App Store review take?

Typically 1–2 days for iOS apps, though this varies. The Mac App Store has been running slower (5–10 days in early 2026). [Runway publishes live review time data](https://www.runway.team/appreviewtimes) updated continuously. Submitting on weekdays and avoiding major Apple event windows (WWDC, product launches) tends to reduce wait times. Expedited review is available for critical bug fixes via App Store Connect.

### What are the most common App Store rejection reasons?

Generally, top rejection reasons are:
- **Crashes and bugs.** The app crashes during review or has obvious bugs. Always test on a real device before submitting.
- **Incomplete or placeholder content.** The app has "lorem ipsum" text, grayed-out buttons, or features that don't work.
- **Inaccurate metadata.** The description, screenshots, or keywords don't match what the app actually does.
- **Privacy policy missing.** Any app that collects user data (or uses any third-party SDK that does) must include a privacy policy URL in App Store Connect and link to it from within the app.
- **In-app purchase not attached.** IAPs must be in "Ready to Submit" state and explicitly attached to the app version before submission.
- **Guideline 4.0 (Design).** UI doesn't meet iOS Human Interface Guidelines, or the app is a thin wrapper around a website.

To detect rejections in your app before submitting, try the [Reviewer Agent](https://github.com/blitzdotdev/app-store-review-agent) which roleplays as an App Store reviewer following all the 100+ guidelines.

### Can I automate App Store Connect?

Yes. Blitz's built-in MCP server lets Claude Code or any AI agent drive the entire App Store Connect submission workflow: filling forms, uploading screenshots, configuring IAPs, and submitting for review, using natural language instructions. Apple also provides the [App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/api/) for direct automation.

### How do I set up in-app purchases in App Store Connect?

1. In App Store Connect, go to your app → **Monetization** → **In-App Purchases**
2. Create each product (consumable, non-consumable, or auto-renewable subscription), set the product ID, reference name, price, and localized display name/description
3. Set the product status to **Ready to Submit**
4. Before submitting your app version for review, go to the version page and attach each IAP under **In-App Purchases and Subscriptions**

Blitz handles steps 2–4 natively, including attaching IAPs to the version. This is the step most developers miss, which causes rejections.

### How do I add screenshots for App Store submission?

Blitz supports three display types: iPhone 6.7", iPad Pro 12.9", and Mac. Required pixel dimensions:

- **iPhone 6.7"**: 1290×2796, 1284×2778, 1242×2688, or 1260×2736
- **iPad Pro 12.9"**: 2048×2732
- **Mac**: 1280×800, 1440×900, 2560×1600, or 2880×1800

Capture screenshots from the iOS Simulator, then drag them into Blitz's screenshot track or let Claude Code manipulate slots directly with `screenshots_put_track_slot`, `screenshots_remove_track_slot`, `screenshots_reorder_track`, and `screenshots_save`.

### Why does my app keep getting rejected?

The most frequent causes beyond the list above: missing or broken deep links listed in the metadata, sign-in credentials not provided to the reviewer (add a demo account in App Store Connect), and entitlements that don't match what the app actually uses. Review [Apple's App Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) and run through [Adapty's pre-submission checklist](https://adapty.io/blog/how-to-pass-app-store-review/) before each submission.

### Does Blitz work with Claude Code and Codex?

Yes. Blitz works with both Claude Code and Codex. Install Blitz, launch it, and you can either launch Claude Code/Codex in the built-in terminal or externally. Claude Code/Codex can then control simulators, generate tests, and submit to App Store Connect without leaving the terminal.
