## What is this?

**Paperclip Desktop** is an unofficial [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) wrapper around [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip). It bundles Paperclip (via the official `@paperclipai/server` npm package) inside a native desktop app for macOS. Windows and Linux builds are coming soon.

The goal is simple: **make running Paperclip as easy as opening an app.**

- 🖱 **One click to launch** — double-click the app and Paperclip starts automatically. No terminal, no `pnpm install`, no Node.js setup.
- 🌐 **Remote connection mode** — connect the desktop shell to verified upstream Paperclip remotes in authenticated mode, with saved connections and quick reconnects.
- 📦 **Paperclip inside** — ships an unmodified build of the upstream Paperclip server and UI. What you get in the app is exactly what you'd get by cloning and running the main repo.
- 🔄 **Auto-updates** — pulls new desktop releases automatically via GitHub Releases.
- 🖥 **Native menus, windowing, and system tray** — the Paperclip UI, but as a real desktop app.

Under the hood, the app can either:

1. Run the embedded local server flow
2. Or verify a remote Paperclip origin via `/api/health` and `/api/auth/get-session` before loading it in a restricted remote-safe Electron window

When local mode is active, the server is cleanly shut down when you quit the app.

> For everything Paperclip itself can do — orchestrating AI agents, running autonomous companies, governance, budgets, org charts, etc. — see the **[upstream Paperclip repo](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip)**. This project does not modify or extend Paperclip's functionality; it only packages it.

This is an **independent community distribution**. It is not an official Paperclip release. All credit for Paperclip itself goes to the upstream project and its authors.

## Quickstart

### Install the desktop app

Download the latest installer for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/aronprins/paperclip-desktop/releases):

- **macOS** — `.dmg` (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- **Windows** — _coming soon_
- **Linux** — _coming soon_

Open the app. Paperclip starts automatically and the dashboard opens in the app window. That's it.

### Prefer the original?

If you'd rather run Paperclip yourself from source (no desktop wrapper), follow the upstream instructions:

```bash
npx paperclipai onboard --yes
```

Or:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip.git
cd paperclip
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

See [github.com/paperclipai/paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) for full docs.

<br/>

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 20+, pnpm 9.15+.

```bash
pnpm install           # Install deps
pnpm dev               # Run Electron in dev mode against the bundled server
pnpm build             # Compile the Electron main/preload TypeScript
pnpm test:connections  # Run connection persistence, preflight, and origin-policy tests
pnpm prepare-server    # Stage the Paperclip server bundle into build/
pnpm build-ui          # Stage the Paperclip UI
pnpm pack              # Build an unpacked app directory (no installer)
pnpm dist              # Build full installers for the current platform
pnpm dist:mac          # macOS (.dmg + .zip, signed/notarized via local script)
```

Key files:

- `src/main.ts` — Electron main process: launcher IPC, local/remote boot orchestration, menu actions, and server lifecycle
- `src/connection/` — Connection persistence, remote validation/preflight, and exact-origin window policy helpers
- `src/launcher-html.ts` — Internal launcher UI for the chooser, remote connect flow, saved connections, and local boot states
- `src/preload.ts` — Preload script for the renderer
- `src/updater.ts` — Auto-update wiring (`electron-updater` against GitHub Releases)
- `electron-builder.yml` — Packaging config; bundles the `@paperclipai/server` npm package plus a platform-specific Node.js binary into `Resources/app-server/`
- `scripts/` — Build and release automation (server staging, macOS notarization, etc.)
