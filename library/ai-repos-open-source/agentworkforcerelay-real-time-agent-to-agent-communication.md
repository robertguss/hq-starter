## Documentation

- **Web:** [agentrelay.com/docs](https://agentrelay.com/docs)
- **Markdown:** [agentrelay.com/docs/markdown](https://agentrelay.com/docs/markdown) — plain-text docs for LLMs and terminal use

## Usage

```typescript
import { AgentRelay, Models } from '@agent-relay/sdk';

const relay = new AgentRelay();

relay.onMessageReceived = (msg) => console.log(`[${msg.from} → ${msg.to}]: ${msg.text}`);

const channel = ['tic-tac-toe'];

const x = await relay.claude.spawn({
  name: 'PlayerX',
  model: Models.Claude.SONNET,
  channels: channel,
  task: 'Play tic-tac-toe as X against PlayerO. You go first.',
});
const o = await relay.codex.spawn({
  name: 'PlayerO',
  model: Models.Codex.GPT_5_3_CODEX_SPARK,
  channels: channel,
  task: 'Play tic-tac-toe as O against PlayerX.',
});

console.log('Waiting for agents to be ready...');
await Promise.all([relay.waitForAgentReady('PlayerX'), relay.waitForAgentReady('PlayerO')]);
console.log('Both ready. Starting game.');

relay.system().sendMessage({ to: 'PlayerX', text: 'Start.' });

const FIVE_MINUTES = 5 * 60 * 1000;
await AgentRelay.waitForAny([x, o], FIVE_MINUTES);
await relay.shutdown();
```

## Claude Code Plugin

Use Agent Relay directly inside Claude Code — no SDK required. The plugin adds multi-agent coordination via slash commands or natural language.

```
/plugin marketplace add Agentworkforce/skills
/plugin install claude-relay-plugin
```

Once installed, coordinate agents with built-in skills:

```
> /relay-team Refactor the auth module — split the middleware, update tests, and update docs
> /relay-fanout Run linting fixes across all packages in the monorepo
> /relay-pipeline Analyze the API logs, then generate a summary report, then draft an email
```

Or just describe what you want in plain language:

```
> Use relay fan-out to lint all packages in parallel
> Split the migration into three relay workers — one for the schema, one for the API, one for the frontend
```

See the [plugin README](https://github.com/AgentWorkforce/skills/tree/main/plugins/claude-relay-plugin) for full details.
