# OpenClaw Knowledge System (Sanitized Public Template)

A public, sanitized template of the **raw → compiled knowledge loop** we implemented internally for OpenClaw operations.

> Inspired by ideas shared by [@karpathy](https://x.com/Karpathy) ([original tweet](https://x.com/BradGroux/status/2040648338589069598)). Thank you for pushing practical, corpus-first workflows into the mainstream.

## Why this exists

Most teams lose context because notes are fragmented and synthesis is inconsistent.
This template turns that into a repeatable system:

1. Capture source evidence in `raw/`
2. Compile reusable operational knowledge in `compiled/`
3. Preserve lineage links (what synthesis came from which sources)
4. Query corpus first before inventing context from scratch
5. Run periodic health checks for drift, staleness, and contradictions

## Repository structure

```text
research/knowledge-system/
├── README.md
├── index.md
├── raw/
│   └── {stream}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/
│       ├── SOURCES.md
│       └── snapshots...
└── compiled/
    └── {stream}/
        ├── overview.md
        └── runs/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
scripts/
└── knowledge-compile.sh
```

## What’s new in v2

- Redaction policy with practical before/after examples
- Quality gates for metadata, contradiction checks, freshness, and lineage
- Maturity model (L1→L5) to stage adoption
- Operational workflows (daily/weekly)
- Lightweight ROI metrics
- Anti-pattern catalog
- Weekly synthesis template + example artifact

## Quick start

### 1) Create your first streams

Pick 1-3 streams (examples):
- `product`
- `customer-support`
- `platform-ops`

### 2) Ingest one day of raw evidence

Create:
- `research/knowledge-system/raw/<stream>/<date>/`
- `SOURCES.md` with metadata (`source`, `captured_at`, `tags`, `confidence`)

### 3) Compile it

Run:

```bash
bash scripts/knowledge-compile.sh 2026-04-04
```

This creates deterministic run notes with lineage anchors in `compiled/*/runs/`.

### 4) Query discipline

Before planning/execution asks, check compiled pages first, then raw evidence if needed.

### 5) Health checks

Recommended cadence:
- Daily: ingest + compile for active streams
- Tue/Fri: stale pages, broken links, conflicting facts, missing next actions

### 6) Weekly synthesis

Create one weekly artifact using `templates/weekly-synthesis.md` to capture:
- changed assumptions
- risks
- decisions
- unknowns
- next actions + lineage links

## Agent ingestion flow (drop-in workflow)

Use this when wiring the repo into an agentic loop.

### Step 1: Bootstrap once

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BradGroux/openclaw-knowledge-system-template.git
cd openclaw-knowledge-system-template
```

### Step 2: Define streams
Create stream folders under:
- `research/knowledge-system/raw/<stream>/`
- `research/knowledge-system/compiled/<stream>/`

Start with 1–3 streams for signal quality.

### Step 3: Ingest daily raw evidence
For each active stream/date:
1. Add snapshots (notes, decisions, task exports, etc.)
2. Update `SOURCES.md` with required metadata:
   - `source`
   - `captured_at`
   - `tags`
   - `confidence`

### Step 4: Run compile pass
```bash
bash scripts/knowledge-compile.sh "$(date +%F)"
```

### Step 5: Query protocol for agents
Before answering non-trivial requests:
1. Read `compiled/<stream>/overview.md`
2. Read latest `compiled/<stream>/runs/<date>.md`
3. Trace to raw `SOURCES.md` when confidence is low or conflicts appear
4. Only then synthesize response or plan

### Step 6: Weekly governance
- Run Tue/Fri health checks (`docs/quality-gates.md`)
- Publish one weekly synthesis from `templates/weekly-synthesis.md`
- Track metrics in `docs/metrics.md`

### Step 7: Public-sharing guardrail
Before publishing or syncing outside your org:
```bash
bash scripts/sanitize-scan.sh .
```
Then complete `docs/sanitization-checklist.md` and `docs/public-redaction-policy.md` review.

## Sanitization policy (important)

This repo is designed for public sharing. Keep it safe:

- No personal emails, phone numbers, IDs, or tokens
- No private org names unless already public
- No local machine paths (`/Users/...`, `/home/...`)
- No internal hostnames, ports, or private URLs
- No customer data, credentials, secrets, or proprietary prompts

See `docs/sanitization-checklist.md` for a pre-publish checklist.
