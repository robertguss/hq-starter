Incognide unifies chat, code, documents, web browsing, and media into a tileable workspace with intelligent context and composable automations.

Built for seamless workflows, Incognide eliminates distractions and context switching. A path-based organization keeps your work structured naturally, while auto-saving workspaces let you resume any project exactly where you left off. No more juggling desktops, drowning in browser tabs, or hunting for scattered files.


### Highlights

- Write and run code, use terminals, build reusable workflows and tools that chain together natural language and templateable code through jinja execution templates.
- Browse the web, read and annotate PDFs, view 3D STL models, analyze data and create dashboards, compile LaTeX.
- Edit DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, MAPX.
- Arrange chats, editors, PDFs, browsers, terminals, 3D viewers as your work evolves — each tab maintains independent state.
- Manage agents, have them run on scheduled jobs, edit team context, integrate with MCP Servers, approve or reject suggested memories, prune and evolve knowledge graphs.
- Schedule automated memory extraction, knowledge graph evolution, and context compression.
- Fine-tune your own image and text models using curated data from your conversations and memories.
- Built-in Pomodoro timer with programmable schedules and break enforcement.
- Specialized tools for image, video, and audio generation.

- [npcts](https://github.com/npc-worldwide/npcts) - React component library (installed via npm)
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Ollama (optional, for local models)

### Setup

**Option 1: Manual setup**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/npc-worldwide/incognide.git
cd incognide
npm install
```

**Option 2: Via npcsh** (installs to `~/.npcsh/incognide`)
```bash
npcsh> /incognide
```

### Running

```bash
python incognide_serve.py   # Backend
npm run dev                   # Frontend (Vite)
