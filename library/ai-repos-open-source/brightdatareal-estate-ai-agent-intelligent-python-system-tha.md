## 🌟 Overview

Real Estate AI Agent System is a Python-based solution that leverages AI agents and Bright Data's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to extract, process, and deliver structured real estate property data from multiple sources.

- Automates public property data extraction from real estate websites like [Zillow](https://brightdata.com/products/web-scraper/zillow), [Realtor.com](https://brightdata.com/products/web-scraper/realtor), Redfin, and more  
- Integrates with Bright Data proxies for robust anti-bot and geo-unblocking  
- Uses Nebius Qwen LLM for adaptive, schema-validated property data extraction  
- Outputs results as structured JSON for analytics or downstream applications
