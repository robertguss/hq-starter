# xcraft

CLI for building and running Xcode projects from the terminal, aiming to simplify agentic development on Apple platforms. Supports `.xcworkspace`, SPM `Package.swift`, and Tuist `Project.swift`.

## Features

- Auto-detect `.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift`, and Tuist `Project.swift` projects
- Tuist integration — automatically runs `tuist generate` before building
- Interactive selection of workspace, scheme, configuration, and destination
- Cached selections for repeat builds — configure once, run many times
- Named profiles (`--profile`) — maintain multiple configurations side by side
- Build, clean, and launch in one command
- Launch on simulators, physical devices, and macOS
- Pipe build output through [xcbeautify](https://github.com/cpisciotta/xcbeautify) when available
- Build Server Protocol (BSP) integration — SourceKit-LSP support via [xcode-build-server](https://github.com/SolaWing/xcode-build-server)
- Designed for headless / CI / agent-driven workflows

## Install

```sh
cargo install xcraft
```

Or from the Git repository:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/BugenZhao/xcraft
```

## Usage

```sh
# Show available commands
xcraft help

# Build and run (interactively selects workspace, scheme, destination on first use)
xcraft launch

# Build without launching
xcraft build

# Clean build products
xcraft clean

# Other commands...

# Interactively re-select workspace, scheme, configuration, and destination
xcraft configure

# List workspaces / schemes / configurations / destinations
xcraft workspaces
xcraft schemes
xcraft configs
xcraft destinations

# Clear cached selections
xcraft reset
```

All resolve options (workspace, scheme, configuration, destination) are cached in `.xcraft/state.toml` so you only need to select them once. Use `xcraft configure` to re-select, or `xcraft reset` to clear.

### Profiles

Use `--profile <name>` to maintain multiple configurations side by side. Each profile stores its selections in a separate file (`.xcraft/state.<name>.toml`).

```sh
# Set up a simulator profile
xcraft configure --profile sim --destination "simulator:..."

# Set up a device profile
xcraft configure --profile device --destination "device:..."

# Build with a specific profile
xcraft launch --profile sim
xcraft launch --profile device

# Clear a specific profile
xcraft reset --profile sim
```

Without `--profile`, the default `.xcraft/state.toml` is used as before.

### Build Server Protocol (BSP)

xcraft integrates with [xcode-build-server](https://github.com/SolaWing/xcode-build-server) to provide SourceKit-LSP with accurate compile commands — enabling code completion, diagnostics, and jump-to-definition in editors without Xcode.

```sh
# Install xcode-build-server (one-time)
brew install xcode-build-server

# Generate buildServer.json from current xcraft state
xcraft bsp configure

# Build at least once to generate compile commands
xcraft build

# Done — SourceKit-LSP will now use xcraft as the BSP entry point
```

When you change workspace or scheme via `xcraft configure`, the BSP state is automatically updated. After a successful `xcraft build` or `xcraft launch`, the build root is also kept in sync.

This pairs well with the [Claude Code LSP plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#code-intelligence), giving Claude full code intelligence for Swift / Objective-C projects.
