Markdown Content:
The self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/). The only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions.

## What is Hermes Agent?[​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/#what-is-hermes-agent "Direct link to What is Hermes Agent?")

It's not a coding copilot tethered to an IDE or a chatbot wrapper around a single API. It's an **autonomous agent** that gets more capable the longer it runs. It lives wherever you put it — a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure (Daytona, Modal) that costs nearly nothing when idle. Talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM you never SSH into yourself. It's not tied to your laptop.
